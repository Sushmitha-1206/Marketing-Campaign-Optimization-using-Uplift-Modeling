# Marketing-Campaign-Optimization-using-Uplift-Modeling

This project applies uplift modeling to evaluate and optimize marketing strategies by estimating the causal impact of different promotional offers Discount and Buy-One-Get-One (BOGO) on customer conversions. Traditional models predict the likelihood of conversion, but uplift modeling goes further by identifying which customers are more likely to convert because of the promotion
Uplift modeling works by estimating the causal effect of a treatment—such as a marketing promotion—on an individual's behavior, rather than simply predicting outcomes. In this project, the mechanism involves splitting customers into treatment and control groups, where the treatment group receives a promotion (either Discount or BOGO), and the control group receives no offer. Instead of predicting who will convert, uplift models are trained to predict how much more likely a person is to convert because they received the treatment. This is achieved using models like Uplift Random Forest and T-Learner with XGBoost, which are designed to estimate the difference in outcomes between treated and untreated individuals with similar characteristics. The model outputs an uplift score for each customer, representing the predicted increase in conversion probability due to the treatment. Customers with high uplift scores are ideal targets for the promotion, as they are likely to respond positively because of the offer, rather than regardless of it. This mechanism enables marketers to allocate resources more efficiently, reduce wasted spend, and drive higher campaign ROI by focusing efforts only on those who are causally affected by the marketing action.
